This project contends that class dynamics — grounded in the economic and occupational structures of the Greek cities, and manifesting themselves in the social, political, and cultural oppositions that characterised them — are fundamental for understanding the emergence, nature, and development of Greek democracies.

Class, for instance, plays a central role in Aristotle's analysis of contemporary politics. In his view, the citizenry of any *polis* could be divided into two parts, the rich and the poor, with further, complex subdivisions based on occupation.

<p><strong>For this keen observer of the politics of his day, thinking about Greek politics in terms of class was indispensable.</strong></p>

Yet class has been all but abandoned as an explanatory concept by most modern scholars. It is this project's aim to put class back where Aristotle placed it: at the heart of the analysis of ancient Greek politics and society.
