The first lecture of the ClassDem project was delivered by **Professor Matt Simonton** (Arizona State University) on the topic of demagogues and their role in ancient Greek class politics.

## Abstract

The lecture explored the rich and often hostile vocabulary used by ancient Greek elites to describe popular political leaders: dogs, ticks, monsters, madmen. Professor Simonton argued that this language reveals deep anxieties about class politics and the challenge that democratic leadership posed to traditional aristocratic authority.

Rather than dismissing this hostile rhetoric, the lecture examined what it tells us about the actual functions of demagogues in mediating class conflict, mobilising popular constituencies, and challenging elite dominance in the Greek city-states.
