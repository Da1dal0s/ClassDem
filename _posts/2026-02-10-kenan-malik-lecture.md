## About the Event

Join Kenan Malik—writer, Observer columnist and BBC broadcaster—for a lecture exploring the tangled history of class, race, and identity in modern Britain.

Malik is the author of *Not So Black and White: A History of Race from White Supremacy to Identity Politics*, praised by Paul Gilroy as "a precious provocation" that "unsettles the absurdities, pieties and default settings of contemporary race-talk." A veteran of anti-racist activism in 1980s Britain, he brings both scholarly depth and lived experience to one of our most contested debates.

The talk is co-hosted by the ERC/UKRI project Class Struggle in Greek Democracy and by the School of History, Classics and Archaeology as part of The Class Series.

## About the Speaker

Kenan Malik presents Analysis on BBC Radio 4 and writes a weekly column for the Observer. His books include: *Not So Black and White*, *The Quest for a Moral Compass* and *From Fatwa to Jihad*, which was shortlisted for the Orwell Prize.
